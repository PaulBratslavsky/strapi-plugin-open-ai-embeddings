# Strapi Open AI Embeddings Plugin

The Strapi Cloud Content Embedding Plugin is designed to bridge the gap between your Strapi-managed content and your OpenAI chatbot. 

By translating your data into meaningful text embedding, this plugin facilitates the delivery of intelligent, context-aware responses by your AI chatbot.

As a result, your AI chatbot gains the ability to comprehend and contextualize user inquiries based on your unique content.

With this plugin, your chatbot will no longer give canned responses. Instead, it becomes a virtual expert on your content, able to answer user questions with the contextual precision and nuance you've always aimed for. 

At least, that is the goal.   

The plugin is built as a starting point for you to either build on top of via "feature pull request" or clone and build your own variation.  

It is entirely open source and is built by me with love and as a learning opportunity.  

Feedback and improvements are welcomed.

Make sure to star on Git Hub if you like the effort that I put into it.

Thank you.

With love,

Paul
